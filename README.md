# Enhancing secuirty with speech recognition: A voice-based access control
This project implements a hands-free speech recognition system that allows users to securely access their confidential data using predefined passphrases. Each user has a unique passphrase, which, when matched with their stored password, grants access to their files.

The system integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, and leverages Google’s Recognize_speech API to detect and convert spoken phrases into text. The spoken text is then matched against predefined passphrases to authenticate users.
